# Basic guide to learn Xamarin


### Getting started

Xamarin.Forms provides a way to quickly build native apps for iOS, Android, Windows and macOS, completely in C#.

- Install Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio

### You should have the following tools:

- **Windows**
	- [Visual Studio 2015 or 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com)
  
- **Mac**
	- [Xamarin Studio](https://www.xamarin.com/studio) or [visual studio preview](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/)

- **Windows and Mac**
  - [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com) - Genymotion is a fast third-party emulator that can be used instead of the default Android emulator. In some cases it's as good as or better than developing on actual devices!
  - [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) - Postman is a powerful HTTP client for testing web service.

- Data Binding

- **Views** We use the word 'view' to refer to visual elements like buttons, texts or text boxes, 
  also known as controls or widgets on other platforms. The content of the following table is taken from [here](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/user-interface/controls/views/)
  
  | TYPE  | DESCRIPTION |
  | ------------- | ------------- |
  | ActivityIndicator	| A visual control used to indicate that something is ongoing. This control gives a visual clue to the user that something is happening, without information about its progress.	  |
  | BoxView           | A View used to draw a solid colored rectangle. BoxView is a useful stand-in for images or custom elements when doing initial prototyping. BoxView has a default size request of 40x40. If you need a different size, assign the VisualElement.WidthRequest and the VisualElement.HeightRequest. |
  | Button	          | A button View that reacts to touch events.	  |
  | DatePicker        | A View that allows date picking. The visual representation of a DatePicker is very similar to the one of Entry, except that a special control for picking a date appears in place of a keyboard |
  | Editor	          | A control that can edit multiple lines of text. |
  | Entry             | A control that can edit a single line of text. Entry is a single line text entry. It is best used for collecting small discrete pieces of information, like usernames and passwords. |
  | Image	            | A View that holds an image.  |
  | Label             | A View that displays text in a read only format. A Label is used to display single-line text elements as well as multi-lines blocks of text.  |
  | ListView	        | An ItemView that displays a collection of data as a vertical list. |
  | OpenGLView	      | A View that displays OpenGL content. |
  | Picker	          | A View control for picking an element in a list. The visual representation of a Picker is similar to a Entry, but a picker control appears in place of a keyboard. |
  | ProgressBar	      | A View control indicating a progress. |
  | SearchBar	        | A View control that provides a search box.|
  | Slider	          | A View control that inputs a linear value. |
  | Stepper	          | A View control that inputs a discrete value, constrained to a range.|
  | Switch	          | A View control that provides a toggled value.  |
  | TableView	        | A View that holds rows of Cells.  |
  | TimePicker	      | A View control that provides time picking. The visual representation of a TimePicker is very similar to the one of Entry, except that a special control for picking a time appears in place of a keyboard. |  
  | WebView	          | A View that presents HTML content. |

### Purpose & Goal

More than a primer, these examples are intended to get programmers up to speed on xamarin as fast as possible so they 
can begin using xamarin productively. These examples only cover the language. To increase your understanding, 
you are encouraged to experiment with them along the way. Play the 'what-if' game. 

You could read the different examples with theory and you have another place called “development app” 
where you can download some app and continue developing (expanding features).
